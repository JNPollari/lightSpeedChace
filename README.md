# Light Speed Chase

This was a game project of mine during summer 2019

## Getting Started

To run the game you need Unity game engine.

### Prerequisites

To run and modify the project, you will need Unity game engine with c# editor. You should be able to just open the poject with Unity from local repository and build the game itself with Unity after that.
